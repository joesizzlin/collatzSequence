# collatzSequence

##  This is my completed chapter 3 practice project from the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" By: Al Sweigart

Below are the objectives:
1. Write a function that implements the Collatz sequence
2. Use that function to write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps calling collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1
3. Add try and except statements to detect whether the user types in a non-integer string

More details are commented in collatzSequence.py

This project is done, so feel free to comment or collaberate.
